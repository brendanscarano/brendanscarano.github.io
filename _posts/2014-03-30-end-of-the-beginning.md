After 12 weeks Phase 0 is over, and DBC will officially be starting tomorrow. The past 12 weeks have been a whirlwind of information and I have really loved learning so much. It&apos;s amazing to look back and see what I knew in the beginning of 2014, to what I know now. 

The 12 weeks were split into 4 separate units
<ul>
  <li>Weeks 1-3: Foundations of Ruby (methods, recursion, regular expressions, classes)</li>
  <li>Weeks 4-6: Object Oriented Design, Databases</li>
  <li>Weeks 7-9: Front End Development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git)</li>
  <li>Weeks 10-12: Review</li>
</ul>

I'm going to post a more detailed description of Phase 0 at a later time (and will update this post here) but for now I'm focusing on tomorrow. Dev Bootcamp is finally here&hellip;
