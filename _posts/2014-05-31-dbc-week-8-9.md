As strange as it feels to say, the 21 week journey is complete, Dev Bootcamp is over&hellip;

This was only the first few steps in the long road to becomming an expert web developer/software engineer but I'm glad the first few steps are now complete.

I will be writing a full blog post on my final 2 weeks at DBC, along with a recap on my entire experience in the coming weeks.
