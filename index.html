	<h2>Hi! I'm Brendan.</h2>

	<p>I build things at <a href="https://intelligentretaillab.com/" target="_blank">Intelligent Retail Lab by Walmart</a>.

	<p>I also build things in my free time such as:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://144blocks.com/" target="_blank">144blocks</a>, a web app for tracking how you spend your time every day.  This was voted a top 10 product on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/144blocks" target=")blank">Product Hunt</a> in May 2018, and was featured on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/manage-your-life-10-minutes-at-a-time-with-144blocks-1832558217" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>I sometimes <a href="/posts">write</a> about new things I'm working on or technologies I'm using.</p>

	<p>When I'm not looking at JavaScript I'm probably at some sort of live music event, improv show, playing hockey, or rooting for the New York Football Giants!</p>
