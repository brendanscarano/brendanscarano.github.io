	<h2>Hi! I'm Brendan.</h2>

	<p>I build web experiences for advertisers across the globe at <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/?ref_=logo" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

	<p>In the past I've also worked on:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Internal Tools at <a href="https://intelligentretaillab.com/" target="_blank">Intelligent Retail
			Lab by Walmart</a></li>
		<li>Prototypes and Internal Tools at <a href="https://jet.com/"
			target="_blank">Jet</a></li>
		<li>The Mobile Web Rental Car path at <a href="https://www.priceline.com/"
			target="_blank">Priceline</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>I sometimes work on side projects and have built:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://144blocks.com/" target="_blank">144blocks</a>, a web app for tracking how you spend your time every day.  This was voted a top 10 product on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/144blocks" target=")blank">Product Hunt</a> in May 2018, and was featured on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/manage-your-life-10-minutes-at-a-time-with-144blocks-1832558217" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a>.</li>

		<li>Two iOS apps: one for deleting unwanted contacts, the other for sharing photos with friends. They are both now deprecated but you can read about how I built them here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/taking-idea-from-paper-app-store-2-years-later-brendan-scarano/" target="_blank">Taking an idea from paper to the app store, 2 years later</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>I sometimes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanscarano/detail/recent-activity/posts/" target="_blank">write</a> about new things I'm working on or technologies I'm using.</p>

	<p>When I'm not looking at code I'm probably at some sort of live music event, acting a bit ridiculous in an improv comedy show, playing hockey, or rooting for the New York Football Giants!</p>
