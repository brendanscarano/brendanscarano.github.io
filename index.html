  <h2>Hi! Welcome to my site.</h2>

  <p>I'm Brendan. I currently work as a Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.priceline.com/" target="_blank">Priceline.com</a> building thier mobile site using technologies such as <b>AngularJS, jQuery, HTML, CSS/SCSS, Gulp, Grunt, and Bower</b>. I've also been focusing on increasing my understanding of using JavaScript on the back-end through <b>Node</b>, <b>Express</b>, and <b>Meteor</b> to help in the implementation of future features.</p>

  <p>I also have experience working on back-end applications in <b>Ruby</b> with <b>Rails</b> or <b>Sinatra</b> as a framework.</p>

  <p>In the evenings I mentor at <a href="https://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> where I help current students better their understanding of core programming concepts in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby.</p>

  <p>Before Priceline, I worked in market research for several years in both operations and client development. I kept a blog during my career transition which you can find <a href="/posts">here</a>.</p>

<!--   <p>I'm also obessed with live music! Here's a (unfinished) <a ui-sref="concert">list</a> of artists I've seen live&hellip; This section is still a work in progress.</p> -->
