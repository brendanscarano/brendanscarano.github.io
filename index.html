  <h2>Hi! Welcome to my site.</h2>

  <p>I'm Brendan. I currently work as a Front End Developer at <a href="https://www.priceline.com/" target="_blank">Priceline.com</a> working with technologies such as <b>AngularJS, Node, Express, HTML, CSS/SCSS, Gulp, Grunt, and Bower</b>. I love learning about new technologies and have been focusing on getting a better understanding of <b>React</b>, and <b>React Native</b> over the last few weeks.

  <p>I also have experience working on back-end applications in <b>Ruby</b> with <b>Rails</b> or <b>Sinatra</b> as a framework.</p>

  <p>In the evenings I mentor at <a href="https://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> where I help current students better their understanding of core programming concepts in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby.</p>

  <p>I sometimes write about new things I've picked up which you can find <a href="/posts">here</a>.</p>

  <p>When I'm not looking at JavaScript I'm probably at some sort of live music event, playing hockey, or rooting for the New York Football Giants!</p>
