	<h2>Hi! I'm Brendan.</h2>

	<p>I build things at <a href="https://intelligentretaillab.com/" target="_blank">Intelligent Retail Lab by Walmart</a>.

	<p>In the past I've also built things at <a href="https://jet.com/" target="_blank">Jet</a>, and <a href="https://www.priceline.com/" target="_blank">Priceline</a>.

	<p>I also build things in my free time such as:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://144blocks.com/" target="_blank">144blocks</a>, a web app for tracking how you spend your time every day.  This was voted a top 10 product on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/144blocks" target=")blank">Product Hunt</a> in May 2018, and was featured on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/manage-your-life-10-minutes-at-a-time-with-144blocks-1832558217" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a>.</li>

		<li>Two iOS apps: one for deleting unwanted contacts, the other for sharing photos with friends. They are both now deprecated but you can read about how I built them here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/taking-idea-from-paper-app-store-2-years-later-brendan-scarano/" target="_blank">Taking an idea from paper to the app store, 2 years later</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>I sometimes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanscarano/detail/recent-activity/posts/" target="_blank">write</a> about new things I'm working on or technologies I'm using.</p>

	<p>When I'm not looking at JavaScript I'm probably at some sort of live music event, pretending I'm someone I'm not in an improv show, playing hockey, or rooting for the New York Football Giants!</p>
