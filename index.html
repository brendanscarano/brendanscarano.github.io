  <h2>Hi! Welcome to my site.</h2>

  <p>I'm Brendan. I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.jet.com/" target="_blank">Jet.com</a> working with technologies such as <b>React, Redux, GraphQL</b> and more. I also have experience working with <b>Angular 1.X, Node, Express, HTML, CSS/SCSS, Gulp, Grunt, and Bower</b> as well as back-end applications in <b>Ruby</b> with <b>Rails</b> or <b>Sinatra</b> as a framework.</p>

  <p>In the mornings and evenings I enjoy working on side projects, and I have two apps in the iOS App Store built with React Native. <a href="https://getgmme.com/" target="_blank">Gmme</a>, is the easiest way to get photos from a friend's Camera Roll, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodbye-contacts/id1229364287?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">Goodbye Contacts</a>, a simple way to remove unwanted contacts from your device.</p>

  <p>I sometimes write about new things I've picked up, which you can find <a href="/posts">here</a>.</p>

  <p>When I'm not looking at JavaScript I'm probably at some sort of live music event, playing hockey, or rooting for the New York Football Giants!</p>
